# MGMT Expression Analysis in TCGA-GBM

This project explores MGMT gene expression in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples from TCGA, using RNA-seq and clinical data.

### Objectives:
- Visualize MGMT expression vs. patient age
- Compare MGMT expression between patients who received radiation therapy and those who did not
- Perform statistical testing on group differences

### Tools Used:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- TCGA data from UCSC Xena

### Status:
This is the first in a planned series of analyses exploring tumor biology and treatment variables in cancer datasets.
